# TypeScript Compilation Fix

## Problem
After TypeScript updates, the app was broken because:
- The HTML file was trying to load TypeScript files directly (`*.ts`)
- Browsers cannot execute TypeScript files - they need to be compiled to JavaScript first
- This caused the cards not to display, inability to add new cards, and unresponsive interface

## Solution
1. **Created TypeScript Configuration**: Added `tsconfig.json` with proper settings for browser compatibility
2. **Compiled TypeScript to JavaScript**: Used `npx tsc` to compile all `.ts` files to `.js` files in `scripts/dist/`
3. **Updated HTML References**: Changed script tags in `index.html` to reference the compiled JavaScript files
4. **Added Build Scripts**: Created `package.json` with convenient build commands

## Files Changed
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `index.html` - Updated script references from `.ts` to `.js`
- `package.json` - Added build scripts
- `scripts/dist/` - Generated JavaScript files

## How to Use
1. **Build the project**: `npm run build` or `npx tsc`
2. **Watch for changes**: `npm run watch` (automatically recompiles on file changes)
3. **Serve the app**: `npm run serve` or `python3 -m http.server 8000`

## Script Loading Order
The scripts are loaded in the correct order:
1. `cards.js` - Defines `initialCards` array
2. `validate.js` - Form validation functions
3. `index.js` - Main application logic (uses `initialCards` from cards.js)

## Notes
- The TypeScript compiler is configured to output plain JavaScript without modules
- All variables and functions are available in the global scope
- The app should now work exactly as before, but with proper TypeScript compilation
